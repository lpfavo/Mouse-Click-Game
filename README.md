This is a puzzle game to help train brain. 

You just use click the picture to change the play role and the planks from startpoint to endpoint.

This peoject ran on eclipse by jdk10, but it may run on provious version.

If you just see the code, you can directly download the single codefiles.

If you want to play and have a try, please download the zip file.

You may see my project has many codefiles. Because it contains a single interface, not just contains a game interface, you can check you record, read some background and guide of the game. So many functions were divided into several files.
